    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

    <p>HomeServiceDev LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates the InspectionIQ mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use InspectionIQ.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Account information.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed password. We do not collect your name, phone number, or payment information.</p>

    <p><strong>Inspection report files.</strong> When you upload a home inspection report, we receive and store the PDF file you provide. These files may contain a property address and inspection findings.</p>

    <p><strong>Property address.</strong> We extract the property address from your uploaded report in order to determine regional cost adjustments. We do not use this address for any other purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage data.</strong> We may collect basic usage information such as when reports are uploaded and processed. We do not use analytics SDKs or advertising trackers.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To create and manage your account</li>
      <li>To analyze your inspection report and generate cost estimates, risk scores, and negotiation tips</li>
      <li>To adjust cost estimates based on the geographic region of the property</li>
      <li>To display your past reports within the App</li>
      <li>To improve the accuracy and performance of the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>InspectionIQ relies on the following third-party services to operate:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — used for account authentication and secure data storage. Your email address and report data are stored on Supabase infrastructure. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude AI)</strong> — the text of your inspection report is sent to Anthropic's API for AI analysis. Anthropic does not use API inputs to train its models by default. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Maps Geocoding API</strong> — the property address extracted from your report is sent to Google for geocoding (converting the address to a geographic region). See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We retain your account information and uploaded reports for as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

    <p>All data is transmitted over HTTPS. Uploaded PDF files are stored in a private, access-controlled storage bucket. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, though no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>InspectionIQ is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

    <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data at any time. To make a request, contact us at the address below. We will respond within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the effective date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
