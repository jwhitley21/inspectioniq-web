    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>⚠️ InspectionIQ provides AI-generated estimates for informational purposes only. Results are not a substitute for a professional physical inspection. Do not make purchase, repair, or legal decisions based solely on this app.</p>
    </div>

    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the InspectionIQ mobile application (the "App") operated by HomeServiceDev LLC ("we," "our," or "us"). By creating an account and using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Informational Purpose Only</h2>

    <p>InspectionIQ uses artificial intelligence to analyze home inspection report documents and generate estimated repair costs, risk scores, and negotiation suggestions. All output produced by the App is <strong>for informational and directional purposes only</strong>. It is not professional advice of any kind — including but not limited to engineering, structural, mechanical, legal, or financial advice.</p>

    <p>The App is designed to help you <strong>prioritize which items to investigate further</strong>, not to serve as a final determination of the condition, value, or safety of any property.</p>

    <h2>2. Not a Substitute for Physical Inspection</h2>

    <p>InspectionIQ analyzes text extracted from PDF inspection reports. It does not conduct a physical examination of any property. AI-generated estimates:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Are based solely on the text content of the uploaded document</li>
      <li>May not reflect current local labor or material costs</li>
      <li>Cannot account for conditions not described in the report</li>
      <li>Cannot detect hidden defects, code violations, or hazards not visible to the original inspector</li>
      <li>May be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before making any purchase, repair, or safety decision, you should consult a licensed professional — such as a contractor, structural engineer, electrician, plumber, or other qualified expert — who can physically assess the property.</p>

    <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>

    <p>THE APP AND ALL CONTENT IT GENERATES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HOMESERVICEDEV LLC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

    <p>We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that AI-generated estimates will be accurate, complete, or suitable for any specific purpose.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HOMESERVICEDEV LLC AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Decisions made to purchase, pass on, or negotiate the price of a property</li>
      <li>Repair or remediation costs incurred based on App estimates</li>
      <li>Losses resulting from reliance on AI-generated content</li>
      <li>Any property condition that was not identified or was mischaracterized</li>
    </ul>

    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You will not rely solely on App output to make property purchase, repair, or safety decisions</li>
      <li>You will seek professional advice from licensed experts before acting on any App output</li>
      <li>You are responsible for verifying the accuracy of any estimates or recommendations</li>
      <li>You will only upload inspection report documents that you have the legal right to share</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <p>The App, including its design, code, and AI-generated output, is owned by HomeServiceDev LLC. You may use App output for your personal, non-commercial decision-making. You may not resell, redistribute, or represent App output as professional advice.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>

    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated by updating the effective date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>

    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>
